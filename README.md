# schemas
Health related JSON Schemas for the IKIGAI network.

Schemas are based on the FHIR JSON Schemas:

- [Patient](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html)
- [Encounter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html)
- [Clinical Impression](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalimpression.html)

@todo: Fork the existing [Verida health scheams](https://github.com/verida/schemas/tree/master/schemas/health) and expand on them to support more of the FHIR standard.
